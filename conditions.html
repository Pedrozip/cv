        <h3><em>The Law of Surprise</em> is a custom as old as humanity itself. The Law dictates that a man saved by another is expected to offer to his savior a boon whose nature is unknown to one or both parties. In most cases, the boon takes the form of the saved man's firstborn child, conceived or born without the father's knowledge. </h3>

        <h2>"The first thing that comes to greet you."</h2>
        <p>When requesting "the first thing that comes to greet you", the price could be the likes of a dog, a halberdier at the gate or "a mother-in-law impatient to holler at her son-in-law when he returns home." 
        </p>
        <h2>"What you find at home yet don't expect."</h2>
        <p>When requesting "what you find at home yet don't expect", the price could be a lover in the wife's bed, but usually a <strong>child</strong> (either newborn or still within the womb).</p>
